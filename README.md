Responsive Portfolio

This is another version of my very first coding project to create a portfolio. This three page portfolio website shows some information about me, has a contact form template, links to my social media, some projects I have done and photos that I have taken.   In this case I used  css for extensive stylization and media queries to provide mobile responsiveness.
